Directory Structure:
 - Teamcode
 - - Hardware Control: For directly interfacing with the hardware. Code here shouldn't do much more than provide more abstract functions to control attachments.
       (cont.) The top level class for this directory is Robot (or RobotV1) which offer general control of the robot
     - Drivers: Control of specific attachments
       - Attachments: For controlling things that influence the environment
       - Drivebase: For controlling the drivebase.
       - Sensors: For controlling things that read from the environment
 - - Logic: For controlling the robot as a whole, doing things such as autonomous driving.
     - Curves: For driving in circles
     - Geometry: OUTDATED FOLDER for possibly doing something w/ path planning
     - Graphs: OUTDATED FOLDER for possibly doing something w/ path planning
     - Pathfinding: INCOMPLETE FOLDER for possibly doing something w/ path planning
     - CLASS DriveUtil: for autonomous driving
 - - Opmodes
     - AutonomousOpModes: Contains autonomous opmodes
       - ABSTRACT CLASS BasicRasiAuton: Extend this class to create a rasi opmode. More instructions in the class
     - TeleOpModes: Contains teleOpModes
     - Testing: Contains miscellaneous opmodes
 - - RASI
     - guides: instructions for how to use RASI
     - Rasi: Contains the interpretor for Rasi. Probably don't need to view it, though of course you can. If you encounter problems, ask Cadence
     - RasiCommands: Contains this years RasiCommand classes.
     - Scripts: Contains rasi scripts. Self explanatory. push to "INSERT/FILE/PATH/HERE/LATER/" on the phone.
 - - Utilities: Contains some stuff that's nice to have
     - Controllers: Contains PID controller.
     - Interrupters: Does a thing that is not really necessary now.
     - json: Contains SafeJsonReader
     - misc: Contains Button(), Timer(), and PushButton()
 - - json20: Contains this year's json.


Robot philosophy:

Two parts:

OpMode Loop:
(for TeleOP, Logic is partially replaced by human control)

while (autonIsNotDone()):
    currentState = HardwareControl.getCurrentState()
    targetState  = Logic.getTargetState(currentState)
    HardwareControl.goToState(targetState)
