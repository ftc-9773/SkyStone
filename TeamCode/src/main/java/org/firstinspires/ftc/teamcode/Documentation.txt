       - Attachments: For controlling things that influence the environment
       - Drivebase: For controlling the drivebase.
       - Sensors: For controlling things that read from the environment
 - - Logic: For controlling the robot as a whole, doing things such as autonomous driving.
     - Curves: For driving in circles
